**Geno** is a small and opinionated static site generator for easily generating a simple site for your [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) projects based on the project's `package.json` file.

## Why?

Because hand crafting a new site for each project can be quite tedious.

## Installation

~~~
npm install -g geno
~~~

## Usage

Run the following in the root directory of your project:

~~~
geno
~~~

**BOOM!** Your project site has been generated.

### geno.json

Adding a `geno.json` in your project's root directory will enable you to add some additional information to your site:

~~~ json
{
  "title": "...",
  "introduction": "<p>...</p>",
  "installation": "<p>...</p>",
  "usage": "<p>...</p>",
  "output": "path/to/ouput",
  "template": "path/to/custom/template",
  "stylesheet": "path/to/custom/stylesheet",
  "javascript": "path/to/javascript/file",
  "docco": "path/to/docs",
  "endorse": true
}
~~~

- `title` is used for naming your module. For example, if you have a module registered as `node-my-module` but you want to call it `My Module` you can add your own value and easily change that. It'll otherwise default to the `name` in specified in the `package.json` file.
- `introduction` is a longer description field that can be used in favor of the `description` in the `package.json` file.
- `installation` is used for adding some additional installation instructions.
- `usage` is for adding notes about the basic usage.
- `output` is where the site will be generated. The default directory is `site`.
- `template` is used for using your own custom template file.
- `stylesheet` is used for using your own custom stylesheet file.
- `javascript` is for adding a JavaScript file to your site.
- `docco` is for simply linking to your [Docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco)-generated documentation.
- `endorse` adds a link to this repository in site's footer. It's turned off by default.

### Custom templates

[Nunjucks](https://github.com/jlongster/nunjucks) is used as the default templating engine.
